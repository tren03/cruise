# Cruise - A Fuzzy Finder for Tabs on Chromium-Based Browsers
## Introduction
****Cruise**** is a browser extension that lets you quickly fuzzy-find open tabs in any Chromium-based browser. It helps you efficiently navigate through your tabs using keyboard shortcuts, inspired by ****Telescope**** from Neovim.

## Installation
Since I haven't published it on the Chrome Web Store yet (as there are a few more features I would like to add), the only way to use it right now is by cloning the repo and manually adding it to your extensions.
1. Clone or download the repository:
   
```sh
git clone https://github.com/tren03/cruise.git
```
3. Open your browser and navigate to chrome://extensions/.
4. Enable Developer mode (toggle on the top right).
5. Click Load unpacked and select the directory where you cloned the repository.
6. The extension is now loaded and ready to use.

## Usasge
I have set the command to open the dialog to Alt+Y, and navigation through the dropdown is done using the up and down arrow keys.
